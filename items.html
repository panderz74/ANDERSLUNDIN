                <p> Inspired by the Grateful Dead, Delta Tau Delta's winter
                    hoodie design quickly became my most popular piece with
                    over 230 sales. This piece has been released twice in three
                    colorways of yellow, baby blue, and black.

                <h2>TONIE ARCON</h2>
                <p>Jackson Michigan's "Tonie Arcon" is a hip-hop rap artist
                    by night and a investment banker working on Wall Street
                    by day. This design was inspired by his dual personality
                    and the idea of "The Way", a mentality he preaches about 
                    recognizing the natural flow of life.

                <p>These earring designs were created as a final project for 
                    my sophomore studio course "Bits and Atoms". These designs
                    were designed in Rhinocerous and 3d resin printed to scale.

                <h2>WELCOME WEEK "CHAMPIONS"</h2>
                <p>This design created for Delta Tau Delta was inspired by
                    vintage Rose Bowl designs which are vastly popular accross
                    campus today. When designing for Greek Life, it is important
                    to reflect modern trends in order to maximize interest and sales.

                <h2>FALL RUSH 2021</h2>
                <p>This tee design was created for the current fall rush season,
                    and was inspired by a color pallete reflecting fall trends.

                <h2>PANK HOODIES</h2>
                <p>This hoodie design was created for a group of artists from
                    Minnesota. These artists pride themselves in being "against the
                    machine" and frequently oppose constucts and the law. This idea
                    is reflected in the design which depicts the "key to the city", 
                    in which questioning present systems can unlock new mindsets.

                    this piece was created in support of Relay for Life. Portions of
                    the cost of each piece sold were donated to charity.

                <h2>FALL RUSH 2020</h2>
                <p>As my first design as the merchandise chair, I depicted a sunset scene using 
                    the colors of purple and yellow which reflect our chapter's identity. This 
                    design went through many iterations and is one of my favorites as it depicts 
                    the house we live in next to the shore.

                <p>As part of our winter rush process, merchandise is created for the brothers. 
                    This design was hand drawn and depicts a ski scene printed on a ice blue
                    longsleeve that evokes the season of winter.

                <h2>DTD QUARANTINE</h2>
                <p> During the peak of quarantine, there were almost zero activities through the 
                    fraternity. This design promoted involvement during a time where it was really
                    tricky to, and made light of a trying time.
